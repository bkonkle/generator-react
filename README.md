Brandon's Yeoman generators for scaffolding new React applications

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @bkonkle/generator-react
```

You can also use yarn if you have your global folder configured:

```sh
yarn global add @bkonkle/generator-react
```

### Yeoman

You'll also need to install Yeoman to use this generator.

```sh
npm i -g yo

(or)

```sh
yarn global add yo
```

## Usage

### Web

To bootstrap a React web project, use the `web` generator:

```sh
mkdir my-new-web-project
cd my-new-web-project

yo @bkonkle/react:web
```

This results in a build setup adapted from [CRA] to allow prefetching (or even server rendering, if you want) and to support runtime environment variables. It uses a Webpack config adapted from [CRA] with tweaks from [Razzle] and lots of customizations. The dev process is adapted from [Razzle], and it runs a base [Express] process at the requested port, launching the Webpack Dev Server at port + 1 to handle hot reloaded resources.

You'll get a layout that looks like this (abbreviated):

```
my-new-web-project
â”œâ”€â”€ assets - build resources not exposed to the public
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts - lightweight build tooling adapted from CRA
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ build.ts - build the project for production use
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ dev.ts - run the project in dev mode alongside Webpack Dev Server
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ run.ts - run the project in production mode using the built bundle
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__ - a stub folder for Jest tests
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ components - components that handle rendering and presentation
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ [data] - (if useApollo is selected) a folder for data-related modules
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ [ApiClient.ts] - (if useApollo is selected) code to initialize an Apollo GraphQL client
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ [AuthClient.ts] - (if useAuth0 is selected) code to initialize Auth0 authentication
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ state - Redux state management using thunks with context, for things like the Apollo client
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ [AuthState.ts] - (if useAuth0 is selected) Redux module to manage auth state
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ StateTypes.ts - a centralized module for types related to Redux
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Store.ts - Redux store initialization and hot reloading code, with thunk context
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ views - views compose components and handle logic and integration
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx - attaches providers for react-router, Redux, and optionally Apollo
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ DummyApp.tsx - attaches dummy providers for rendering things like the error view
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Router.tsx - a simple react-router switch view using routes from Routes.tsx
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ BrowserConfig.ts - prepares and loads configs created by Config.ts below for the browser
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Client.tsx - bootstraps the application in the browser
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Config.ts - reads the server environment to create a config for the browser
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Routes.tsx - uses react-router-dom and react-loadable to describe available routes
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Server.ts - the core Express server that builds a BrowserConfig for each request
â”œâ”€â”€ static - static files made available via the Express server
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ document.html - a webpack-html-plugin template that Server.ts injects the config into
â”œâ”€â”€ .babelrc - includes TypeScript, Emotion, and other plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile - a simple container that uses "yarn run"
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json - used by the Babel plugin
â”œâ”€â”€ tslint.json - starts with Microsoft contrib and overrides a lot
â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.ts - adapted from CRA with customizations
```

### Mobile

To bootstrap a React Native mobile project, use the `mobile` generator:

```sh
mkdir my-new-mobile-project
cd my-new--mobile-project

yo @bkonkle/react:mobile
```

This results in a React Native application using Expo, using [React Navigation] for routing. 

You'll get a layout that looks like this (abbreviated):

```
my-new-mobile-project
â”œâ”€â”€ assets - static resources such as images
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__ - a stub folder for Jest tests
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ components - components that handle rendering and presentation
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ [data] - (same as the web generator)
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ screens - screens compose components and handle logic and integration
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ LoginScreen.tsx - the default route, intended to render a login experience
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ state - (same as the web generator)
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Config.ts - sets up config values for all environments, then exports the current values
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Routes.ts - uses react-navigation to describe available screens
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Theme.ts - some basic app-wide theming tools
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Types.ts - some general types used across the app
â”œâ”€â”€ .babelrc - includes the standard Expo preset
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js - the Expo entry point, which imports the App.tsx component
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json - (same as the web generator)
â””â”€â”€ tslint.json - (same as the web generator)
```

### GraphQL

To bootstrap a GraphQL Api based on Postgraphile, use the `graphql` generator:

```sh
mkdir my-new-graphql-project
cd my-new--graphql-project

yo @bkonkle/react:graphql
```

Answer the questions, and you'll have a brand new web application set up in your current directory. Tada! ðŸŽ‰
